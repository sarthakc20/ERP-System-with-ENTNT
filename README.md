# Simplified ERP System with React - Documentation

Welcome to the Simplified ERP System built with React! This documentation will guide you through setting up and interacting with the website.

*Website URL*
You can access the website at the following URL: https://erp-system-with-entnt.vercel.app

*Setup Instructions*

*Interacting with the Website*
The website consists of the following pages:

1. Dashboard: Provides an overview of key metrics and features of the ERP system. You'll find summaries of the total number of products and orders, along with buttons for quick navigation to the Products and Orders management pages.

2. Orders Calendar View Features: The Orders Calendar View is an optional feature that provides a visual representation of orders based on their expected delivery dates.

# *Workflow for Creating and Building a React App*

# Initialize React App:

Use create-react-app to bootstrap your React project. This command sets up a new React project with all the necessary files and dependencies:

### `npx create-react-app frontend`

Project Structure:

Explore the project structure created by create-react-app. You'll find files and directories such as src, public, package.json, README.md, etc.
The src directory contains your React components and other JavaScript files.
Development:

Open the project in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

Start the development server to see your changes in real-time:

### `npm start`

This command will launch a development server and open your default web browser with the React app running. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reflected in the browser.
